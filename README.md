# Information-Storage-and-Retrieval-Project
This repository is designated for the Information Storage and Retrieval Project, a subject in my third year at Mahidol University. The project is a collaborative effort involving three members: Poomrapee Wareeboutr, Pitchaya Teerawongpairoj, and Sasima Srijanya.

For this project, we developed a Movie Search Engine where users can search for movies and access various details, including descriptions, directors, actors, genres, release dates, and movie runtimes. We utilized Elasticsearch along with HTML and CSS languages for implementation.
